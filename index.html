            To open the console in Chrome, use this keyboard shortcut: Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac) or Cmd +Shift +J (on Windows). As an alternative, you could right-click on the webpage and click "Inspect," and the developers window will appear. Click the "Console" tab in that window. You should use the console. It usually means a combination of a display monitor and an input device, usually a keyboard and mouse pair, which allows a user to input commands and receive visual output from a computer or computer system. It can also refer to specialized computers only meant to play videos.
